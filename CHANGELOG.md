## Unreleased

## [2.0.0] - 2017-05-18

### Changed
- The SQL connector app runs on HTTPS by default. While the application is still
  running as a server on localhost, a TLS certificate issuing server
  ([open source and built and maintained by plotly](https://github.com/plotly/le-bot))
  creates a unique DNS entry that points to `localhost:9495` and creates a unique
  TLS certificate. This happens when the user first starts the app and the
  certificate and the domain entry is saved to the user's plotly connector directory
  in `~/.plotly/connector`.
  These certificates should renew every 60-90 days automatically, generating
  a new unique URL each time.
- The user goes through an Oauth flow when starting the application.
  This flow saves an oauth token to the user's `~/.plotly/connector` directory
  and is used when scheduling updates to grids.
